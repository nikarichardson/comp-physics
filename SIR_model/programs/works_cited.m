Evaluation of this model.
One, our first assumption is that I(t) + R(t) + S(t) = 1; 
Is it possible some people have natural immunity without having 
been infected? Are people who have been infected but exhibited no
symptoms to be counted in the recovered group? 

What about a strain that mutates and evolves, thus rendering
prior immunity meaingless? What if part of the model is vaccinated?

Much credit is due to the referenced Differential Equations textbook, which both explicated the 
SIR model and provided some problems in the section encouraging
analysis of the model.
