# About 
MATLAB program allows for users inputs to the factors of the Drake Equation, which attempts to calculate
the number of civilizations on life-bearing planets in the galaxy that can emit detectable signals.

# Files 
`main`
allows users to input the factors for the Drake Equation and plots the number of civilizations as a function of varying L, which represents how long a civilization can emit signals (i.e. the life span of the civilization) 

`examples`
gives four examples of variable inputs to the Drake Equation and displays the resulting graph with upper and lower bound indicators

`fixed_L`
computes the number of civilizations *N* with the Drake Equation with user inputs for all factors except <i>L</i>, which is a randomly generated number within a pre-prescribed range
